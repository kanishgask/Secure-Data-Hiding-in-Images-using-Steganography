Image Steganography (Encrypt & Decrypt Messages in Images)
📌 Project Overview
This project implements image-based steganography that allows users to securely hide and retrieve secret messages inside an image using a password. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter, and the image processing is handled with OpenCV.

🛠 Features
Encrypt a Secret Message 🔐
Hide a message inside an image without changing its appearance.
Protect the message with a password.
Decrypt the Message 🔓
Extract the hidden message from the image.
Requires the correct password for successful decryption.
GUI-based Interface 🖥️
Simple and easy-to-use GUI for encryption and decryption.
Colorful and responsive design.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python tkinter
2️⃣ Run the Encryption Script
To encrypt a message into an image:

python encrypt_image.py
Select an image.
Enter a secret message.
Enter a password.
Save the encrypted image.
3️⃣ Run the Decryption Script
To decrypt a message from an image:

python decrypt_image.py
Select the encrypted image.
Enter the correct password.
Retrieve the hidden message.
⚡ Usage
🔹 Encrypting a Message
Select an image file.
Enter your secret message.
Enter a password for protection.
Click Encrypt → Save the encrypted image.
🔹 Decrypting a Message
Select the encrypted image file.
Enter the correct password.
Click Decrypt → The message is displayed.
🛡 Security Considerations
The message is hidden at the pixel level but is not strongly encrypted.
For added security, use additional cryptographic encryption (e.g., AES) before encoding.
If the password is incorrect, decryption will fail.
📌 Future Enhancements
🔄 Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
🔑 Stronger encryption methods for added security.
📱 Mobile app version using Python-Kivy or Flutter.
